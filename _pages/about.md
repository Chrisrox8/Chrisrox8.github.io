This blog contains my thoughts and ramblings about software, learning, and just life in general.

I'm a Software Engineer at the Cerner Corporation in Kansas City, MO. I love running, learning new things, and am
lucky enough to have the best wife in the world (I may be a *little* biased).

### More Information

To sum it up, I grew up in the Midwest.

I received my undergraduate Computer Engineering Degree at [Oklahoma Christian University](http://oc.edu/academics/colleges-schools/engineering-computer-science/index.html)
, and got an emphasis in Software.
